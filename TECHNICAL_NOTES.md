## Camera Considerations

### 64MP ArduCam Hawkeye Specifications

- **Sensor**: 64MP Sony IMX686 sensor
- **Resolution**: 9248 x 6944 (native), but we use 4624 x 3472 for better performance
- **Autofocus**: Hardware-based autofocus system
- **Field of View**: Approximately 84° diagonal
- **Interface**: MIPI CSI-2, compatible with Raspberry Pi
- **Features**: Auto-exposure, auto white balance, HDR support

### Performance Optimization

The code is designed to balance between capturing high-quality images and maintaining real-time processing performance:

1. **Dual Resolution Approach**: The camera captures at high resolution but downscales for processing
2. **Efficient Frame Buffering**: Background thread continuously captures frames 
3. **Periodic Autofocus**: Automatically refocuses at set intervals to maintain sharpness

   - Consistent motion trajectory
   - Context-aware filtering (altitude, direction, speed)

4. **Object Tracking**
   - Assigns unique IDs to detected aircraft
   - Tracks objects across multiple frames
   - Records trajectory history
   - Calculates speed and direction vectors
   - Handles object disappearance and reappearance

5. **Detection Filtering**

## Database Design

### Schema Design

The SQLite database uses two primary tables:

1. **Detections Table**: Records individual aircraft detections
   - Primary fields: timestamp, position (x,y), size (width, height)
   - Metadata: contrast ratio, confidence score, image path
   - Performance metrics: speed, direction

2. **Tracking Table**: Maps continuous tracking of the same object
   - Links multiple detections of the same aircraft
   - Records trajectory points for path analysis
   - Enables historical flight path reconstruction

### Optimization Considerations

1. **Indexing Strategy**:
   - Primary index on timestamp for efficient recent queries
   - Secondary indices on position for spatial queries
   - Careful balance between query performance and storage overhead

2. **Data Retention**:
   - Configurable retention period (default: 30 days)
   - Automatic purging of old records to prevent database bloat
   - Option to archive data to external storage

3. **Performance Tuning**:
   - Write-ahead logging for improved concurrent access
   - Transaction batching for multiple inserts
   - Periodic VACUUM operation for database compaction
