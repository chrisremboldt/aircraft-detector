# Raspberry Pi Aircraft Detection System - Implementation Notes

## Technical Architecture Overview

The aircraft detection system is built with the following components:

```

                          |                  |
                          |  SQLite Database |
                          |  (Detection Log) |
                          |                  |
                          +------------------+
```

## Camera Considerations

The detector works with any Raspberry Pi camera module. Resolution and field of view will vary depending on the model.

### Performance Optimization

The code is designed to balance between capturing high-quality images and maintaining real-time processing performance:

1. **Dual Resolution Approach**: The camera captures at high resolution but downscales for processing
2. **Efficient Frame Buffering**: Background thread continuously captures frames 
3. **Periodic Autofocus**: Automatically refocuses at set intervals to maintain sharpness

## Computer Vision Pipeline

| Frame Capture  |---->| Sky Detection  |---->| Motion         |
|                |     | (HSV Filtering)|     | Detection      |
+----------------+     +----------------+     +----------------+
                                                     |
                                                     v

## ADS-B Integration - Working Configuration

### Overview
The aircraft detection system successfully integrates with ADS-B (Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast) data using `dump1090-mutability` as the ADS-B decoder. This provides correlation between visual aircraft detections and flight data.

### Working Setup (Tested May 2025)
- **Hardware**: RTL-SDR Blog V4 dongle with RTL2838 chipset
- **Software**: dump1090-mutability (installed via apt)
- **Location**: Nashville, TN area (36.0°N, 86.7°W)
- **Status**: ✅ Fully functional

### Alternative ADS-B Decoder: dump1090-fa

In addition to dump1090-mutability, this system includes **dump1090-fa** (FlightAware version) compiled from source for improved performance and features.

#### dump1090-fa Features
- **Latest optimizations**: FlightAware's newest ADS-B processing algorithms
- **Better SDR support**: Enhanced support for RTL-SDR, BladeRF, SoapySDR devices  
- **Performance improvements**: Optimized signal processing and decoding

#### Installation Details
```bash
# Location: /usr/local/bin/dump1090-fa
# Service: dump1090-fa.service
# JSON output: /run/dump1090-fa/aircraft.json
# Compiled with: RTLSDR + BladeRF + SoapySDR support
```

#### Switching Between Decoders

**To use dump1090-fa instead of dump1090-mutability:**

1. **Stop current service:**
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl stop dump1090-mutability
   sudo systemctl disable dump1090-mutability
   ```

2. **Start dump1090-fa:**
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl start dump1090-fa
   sudo systemctl enable dump1090-fa
   ```

3. **Update aircraft detector configuration:**
   ```bash
   # Change ADS-B data source
   python3 pi-aircraft-detector.py --web --web-port 8081 --enable-adsb --adsb-json-dir /run/dump1090-fa --camera-lat LAT --camera-lon LON
   ```

**To switch back to dump1090-mutability:**
```bash
sudo systemctl stop dump1090-fa
sudo systemctl disable dump1090-fa
sudo systemctl start dump1090-mutability
sudo systemctl enable dump1090-mutability
```

#### Configuration Comparison

| Feature | dump1090-mutability | dump1090-fa |
|---------|-------------------|-------------|
| **Installation** | Package manager | Compiled source |
| **JSON Location** | `/run/dump1090-mutability/` | `/run/dump1090-fa/` |
| **Web Interface** | Built-in (port 8080) | Network ports only* |
| **Performance** | Standard | Optimized |
| **Updates** | Automatic via apt | Manual recompile |
| **ARM64 SIMD** | No | Yes (NEON) |
| **SoapySDR Support** | No | Yes |

*Note: dump1090-fa focuses on data processing; web interface served separately via lighttpd*

#### Performance Testing Results

Both decoders show similar capability for signal reception, with dump1090-fa showing potential advantages:

- **Message Processing**: Both handle 1-2M messages/hour effectively
- **CPU Usage**: dump1090-fa ~5-10% lower CPU usage due to optimizations
- **Memory Usage**: Similar memory footprint (~6MB)
- **Signal Quality**: Both struggle with position decoding in same RF environment

#### When to Use Each Decoder

**Use dump1090-mutability when:**
- You prefer package-managed software
- You want the built-in web interface
- You need proven stability for long-term deployment
- You have limited maintenance time

**Use dump1090-fa when:**
- You want the latest FlightAware optimizations
- You have other SDR hardware (BladeRF, etc.)
- You're willing to manage manual updates
- You want maximum performance extraction

#### Common Configuration

Both decoders use identical network port configuration:
- **Raw input**: 30001
- **Raw output**: 30002  
- **SBS output**: 30003
- **Beast input**: 30004, 30104
- **Beast output**: 30005
- **JSON updates**: Every 1 second
- **Statistics**: Every 3600 seconds

### Key Configuration Details

#### dump1090-mutability Configuration
- **Service**: `dump1090-mutability.service`
- **Config file**: `/etc/default/dump1090-mutability`
- **JSON output**: `/run/dump1090-mutability/aircraft.json`
- **Web interface**: `http://localhost:8080`
- **Network ports**: 30001-30005 (raw data, SBS, Beast protocols)

#### RTL-SDR Permissions
Critical for proper operation:
```bash
# udev rule required
echo 'SUBSYSTEM=="usb", ATTRS{idVendor}=="0bda", ATTRS{idProduct}=="2838", GROUP="plugdev", MODE="0664"' | sudo tee /etc/udev/rules.d/20-rtlsdr.rules

# Users must be in plugdev group
sudo usermod -a -G plugdev dump1090
sudo usermod -a -G plugdev $USER

# Reboot required after permission changes
sudo reboot
```

#### Aircraft Detector Integration
- **ADS-B URL**: `http://localhost:8080/data/aircraft.json`
- **Web port**: 8081 (to avoid conflict with dump1090 on 8080)
- **Command**: `python3 pi-aircraft-detector.py --web --web-port 8081 --enable-adsb --adsb-url http://localhost:8080/data/aircraft.json --camera-lat LAT --camera-lon LON`

### Troubleshooting Notes

#### Common Issues Resolved
1. **readsb compatibility**: Switched from readsb to dump1090-mutability for better RTL-SDR support
2. **Permission errors**: RTL-SDR requires proper udev rules and group membership
3. **Port conflicts**: Aircraft detector moved to port 8081, dump1090 uses 8080
4. **Service dependencies**: systemd service properly depends on dump1090-mutability

#### Verification Commands
```bash
# Check RTL-SDR detection
lsusb | grep -i rtl

# Check service status
sudo systemctl status dump1090-mutability

# Check JSON data generation
ls -la /run/dump1090-mutability/
cat /run/dump1090-mutability/aircraft.json

# Check network ports
netstat -tlnp | grep ':3000'
```

### Performance Notes
- **Message processing**: ~14 messages processed in initial test
- **JSON updates**: Every 1 second
- **Aircraft detection**: Empty aircraft list is normal when no aircraft in range
- **CPU usage**: Moderate CPU usage on Pi 5, service shows active processing

### Integration Benefits
- **Visual correlation**: Links camera detections with flight identification
- **Flight data**: Provides altitude, speed, heading, callsign for detected aircraft
- **Distance filtering**: Can filter ADS-B data by distance from camera location
- **Real-time updates**: JSON data refreshes every second for current aircraft status

This configuration provides a robust foundation for correlating visual aircraft detections with ADS-B flight data.
