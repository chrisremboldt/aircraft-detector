# AI Agent Guidelines

This document outlines guidelines for AI assistants interacting with this codebase.

## Permissions

AI agents are granted broad permissions to:

1. **Read and analyze** all code, documentation, and project resources
2. **Propose changes** to any part of the codebase
3. **Generate new code** and files for the project
4. **Refactor existing code** to improve quality
5. **Add documentation** to clarify project details
6. **Suggest testing approaches** for code validation
7. **Recommend architecture improvements** for the overall project

## Operating Principles

When working with this codebase, AI agents should:

- Prioritize functional code over theoretical explanations
- Maintain the project's existing conventions and patterns when possible
- Provide clear reasoning for significant changes
- Focus on practical solutions that match the project's goals
- Consider performance, maintainability, and security in all suggestions

## No Restrictions

This project does not impose any special restrictions on AI agents beyond standard ethical considerations. AI assistants should feel empowered to provide their best possible assistance with the codebase.

## Confirmation Policy

No explicit confirmation is required for AI agents to explore options or make suggestions regarding any aspect of the codebase.
